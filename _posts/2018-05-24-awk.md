AWK is one of mostly used text-processing utilities on Linux. It takes its name from initials of its authors - `Aho, Wienberger and Kernighan`. It is a scripting language that processes data files, especially text files that are organized in rows and columns.

AWK is used for stream processing, where the basic unit is the string. **It considers a text file as a collection of fields and records. Each row is a record, and a record is a collection of fields.** The syntax of AWK is as follows:

    awk [options] 'patter {action}' input_file

As an AWK script:

    awk [options] script_name input_file

The most commonly used command-line options of awk are "-F" and "-f":

    -F : to change input field seperator
    -f : to name script file

There are two types of buffers used in AWK - the record buffer and field buffer. 

The field buffer is denoted as $1, $2... $n, where 'n' indicates the field number in the input file. So, $2 indicates the second field (or the second column in a file).

The record buffer is denoted as $0, which indicates the whole record. 

**Example**

fileName : file1.txt

```
    ram    1 get       7
    shyam   2 put      8
    krishna  3 lost    9
    sharma   4 found   8
    archana  5 good    7
    kumari   6 best    6
```
To print third and first field in a file, use the command

    awk '{print $3, $1}' file1.txt

Output:

    get ram
    put shyam
    lost krishna
    found sharma
    good archana
    best kumari

## AWK process flow
AWK scripts are divided into the following three parts - **BEGIN (pre-processing), body (processing) and END (post-processing)**.

**BEGIN** is the part of the AWK script where variables can be initialised and report headings can be created. The processing body contains the data that needs to be processed, like a loop. **END** or the post-processing part analyses or prints the data that has been processed.

        awk 'BEGIN {print "Sum \t average"} {tot=$2+$4; avg=tot/3; print tot,avg} END {print "======================\nProcessing End...\n================="}' file1.txt

Output:

        Sum    average
        8  2.66667
        10  3.33333
        12  4
        12  4
        12  4
        12  4
        ======================
        Processing End...
        =================

## skip blank lines

There are two approaches you can try to filter out lines:

    awk 'NF' data.txt

and

    awk 'length' data.txt

Just put these at the start of your command, i.e.,

    awk -v variable=$bashvariable 'NF { print variable ... }' myinfile

or

    awk -v variable=$bashvariable 'length { print variable  ... }' myinfile

Both of these act as gatekeepers/if-statements.

The first approach works by only printining out lines where the number of fields (NF) is not zero (i.e., greater than zero).

The second method looks at the line length and acts if the length is not zero (i.e., greater than zero)

You can pick the approach that is most suitable for your data/needs.
