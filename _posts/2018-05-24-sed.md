* To edit file in place use option -i  with sed.

* Backup and edit input file in-place use option -i.bkp with sed.

* Replace a string in multiple files

        sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' *.dat

    This will replace word "foo" to "bar" in all *.dat files present in PWD.

        sed -i 'Ns/foo/bar/g' *.dat

    Here N is the Nth line of the text file. This command will find "foo" in Nth line of text fine and replace with "bar". This is not going to check any other line except Nth line.

* Replace several character from a string

        echo ramkrishna | sed 's/ram//g'

    or if want to replace several character from string, then

        echo "ram> krishna <Shar,ma" | sed 's/[<>,]//g'

    The above command will remove > or < or , from the string.

* Show first line number 1-20 in a text file

        sed -n 1,10p FileName.txt

* Append a line after text match

        sed '/<search-pattern>/a <Text-To-Append>' FileName.dat

* Append a line before text match
    
        sed '/<search-pattern>/i <Text-To-Append>' FileName.dat
    
    Example:

        $ cat test
            foo
            bar
            option
            baz

        $ sed '/option/a insert text here' test
            
            foo
            bar
            option
            insert text here
            baz

* Remove line of text from multiple files

        sed '/line of text/d' *.txt

    If your version of sed allows the -i.bak flag (edit in place). If not simply put it in a bash loop:

        for file in $(ls *.txt)
        do
            sed '/line of text/d' $file > $file.new_file.txt
        done
