* Delete command: `di" delete all character within quotes`

* Toggle case of all character from the cursor position to the end of line: `

* Change case of current line to Upper case: `gUU`

* vim options:

        -i  : ignore case

* Run a command to place output in current line

        :r !command 

* Delete all empty lines ( Ref ) 
        
        :g/^$/d

* Delete all empty lines or remove all lines containing only white spaces ( Ref )

        :g/^\s*$/d

* Substitute with ascending numbers:
    * Suppose we want to replace each occurrence of "abc" with "xyz_N" where N is * an ascending number (xyz_1, xyz_2, xyz_3, and so on). One approach uses the * following command:
    
            :let i=1 | g/abc/s//\='xyz_'.i/ | let i=i+1

    * This will replace only first occurrence of each line. There is also command that can replace all, for it look at link below.
