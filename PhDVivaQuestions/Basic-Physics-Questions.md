1. What do you mean by abelian and non-abelian nature of SM?

    <span style="color:blue">   </span>    

2. How do you know that muon, electrons, etc are spin half particles?

    <span style="color:blue">Partial wave expansion: Take muon of any spin and look at its partial wave expansion then compare with actual data to get an idea of spin of muon. </span>

3. Why there is asymmetry between production of W+ and W- bosons in pp colliders?

    <span style="color:blue"> 
    In $p\bar{p}$ collisions, the w+ and w- bosons are produced with equal rates; however, the w+ is mainly produced in the proton direction, whereas the opposite happens for the w-. </span>

    <span style="color:blue"> 
    In pp collision, w production is forward-backward symetric; however, the w- production rate is smaller than the w+ production rate and moreover, the w- is mostly produced at central rapidities, while the w+ is mostly produced at larger rapidities. </span>

    <span style="color:blue"> 
    These w+/w- asymmetries are mainly due to the proton content of u and d quarks and, in particular, to the fact that u quark carry, on average, more parton momentum fraction than d quark. Therefore, the w boson charge asymmetries provide important quantitative information on the size and momentum fraction distribution of the u and d parton densities of the proton.</span>

4. What is the difference between minbias and zero bias events in terms of MC production?
    
    <span style="color:blue"> 
    MinBias requires at least one hit on each side of the detector. In ZeroBias there is no such requirement (the event is recorded whenever there is a collision). It depends on the physics being studied to decide whether you can use MinBias instead of ZeroBias.</span>

3. What is the nature of confinment interaction in compositness? (or Binding mechanism)?

    <span style="color:blue">   </span>

4. What is tha value of Lambda_{QCD}?

    <span style="color:blue">   </span>


5. In LHC going from 8 TeV to 14 TeV, should the number of proton per bunch also increases or decreses and why?

    <span style="color:blue"> 
    Going from 8 TeV to 14 TeV, the per proton radiation will increase. So, total radiation will increase.</span>

    <span style="color:blue"> 
    Also 8 TeV to 14 TeV; 50ns to 25ns less bunch spacing so inter bunch and intra bunch interaction will increase. But, magnetic field for focusing is same. So, bunches will deform. Thus, we need to decrease the number of protons to keep the focusing same at same magnetic field.</span>
    
6. What are uses of low pt photon trigger?
    
    <span style="color:blue"> 
    anomalous coupling, triple and quartic gauge boson coupling.</span>
    
7. Why Delta-R is taken for isolation study?

    <span style="color:blue"> </span>

8. How proton distribution and QCD cross-section for for sample look like?

    <span style="color:blue"> </span>

9. What are the detector components in CMS and their individual resolution? 
Why?

10. Why b-quark has large life time?

11. Explain various object identification and isolation variables?

12. Why |eta| < 1.4442?

13. Why b-tagging efficiency goes down at higher ...?

14. How do you define pile-up?

15. Why use fit function?

16. What is the uncertanity associated with each term and how you calculate 
them?

17. After what energy in LHC we can say we are colliding quark-gluons not 
protons?

18. What is missing transverse energy?

    <span style="color:blue"> 
    This is defined as the magnitude of the missing transverse momentum vector, defined as the projection on the plane perpendicular to the beams of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all reconstructed particles in an event.</span>

19. Transverse mass?

    <span style="color:blue"> 
    $M_{T} = \sqrt{2*p_{T,lep} * E_{T,miss} [1 - cos(\Delta \phi (l, E_{T,miss}))] }$ </span>  

    <span style="color:blue"> 
    To reject multijet background we generally apply cut of $M_T > 40 GeV$</span>

20. Assymetric W-boson production?
    
    <span style="color:blue"> 
    W-boson production is known to be charge asymmetric due to the structure of the proton, with more w+ boson produced than w- boson.</span>

21. Gauge Invariance?

    <span style="color:blue"> 
    Gauge invariance is the central feature of quantum field theory, because they insures that the calculated observable are finite (i.e. the amplitudes in a perturbative expansion are renormalizable).</span>

22. What do we mean by non-abelian nature of QCD?

23. Explain screening and anti-screening effect?

24. Why we require infrared and colliniear safe jets?
