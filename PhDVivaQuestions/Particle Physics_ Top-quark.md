# Particle Physics: **Top-quark**


1. b-quark is very heavy then how it is coming from protons?
   
2. Does top decay or it forms hadrons then decay?
    1. How much time it takes for hadronization?
    2. top-life time?
    3. Time need for hadronization
    4. If top life-time is $10^{-25}$ and hadronization time is $10^{-24}$ then does all top decay before hadronization or some of them do hadronization?

   ~~As we can see that top is the heaviest particle. If a top decays then we need particles that can conserve the charge and the color. Next heaviest em charged particle is the W-boson.~~
   
3. Why t-channel cross-section is surpressed than $t\bar{t}$?

4. What will be the dominated background in case of di-lepton channel?

18. Is there any process from where one can get same sign electrons and muons in final state?
