2. Why is there a continuous distribution of beta particle energies?

3. If the neutrino had mass, what would the Fermi-Kurie plot look like?

4. What is a forbidden transition an what would it look like on a Fermi-Kurie 
plot?

5. Why is the K-conversion electron mono-energetic?

6. How does a Geiger-Muller tube work?

7. What are the trajectories of the beta particles?

8. What is the magnetic field inside the spectrometer when the current is near 
10 amps?

9. Why shouldn’t you open the knife switch when current is flowing?

10. Is the Fermi-Kurie plot useful for the Cs decay?

11. Why is the instrument response to the K-conversion electrons broad? What 
is that telling you about the instrument?

12. What is the energy resolution of the instrument?

13. In the Cs decay, what does the ratio of the area under the K-conversion 
spike to the area under the “beta” peak tell you?

14. What is the absorption cross-section for beta particles vs energy when 
they traverse a piece of material? (Melissinos, pg 150 et seq.)

15. What is the error bar per point?

16. What is a statistically sound way to search for a neutrino mass with your 
data?

17. How susceptible is your result for the endpoint of the Na decay to 
background subtraction?

18. The sources have a strength on order 100 μC; does this correspond to what 
you measured with the Geiger counter?
