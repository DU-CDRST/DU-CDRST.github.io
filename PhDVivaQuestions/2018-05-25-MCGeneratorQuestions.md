1. Should cross-section after hadronization/showering change?

    <span style="color:blue"> 
    In general, without matching/merging, the cross section after parton shower and hadronization should be equal to the initial cross section. This is a fundamental aspect of what the parton shower represents, namely that in the soft/collinear limit the soft emission or splitting can be factorized from the core matrix element and interpreted as a probability for emission. So, the parton shower and hadronization should not change the cross section but rather tell how it "spreads" to different jet multiplicities. A good reference for more information is the presentation in [1]. It's a 4 part lecture with video on CDS if you really want to get into the gory details :)</span>
