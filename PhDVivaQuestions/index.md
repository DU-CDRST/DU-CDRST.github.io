1. b-quark is very heavy then how it is coming from protons?
2. Does top decay or it forms hadrons then decay?
    1. How much time it takes for hadronization?
    2. top-life time?
    3. Time need for hadronization
    4. If top life-time is $10^{-25}$ and hadronization time is $10^{-24}$ then does all top decay before hadronization or some of them do hadronization?
3. Why t-channel cross-section is surpressed than $t\bar{t}$?
4. What will be the dominated background in case of di-lepton channel?
5. Why 4-stages in the LHC chain?
6. What is $\beta^*$?
7. Write the equation of motion for the LHC beam.
8. If the equation of motion is $$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+kx=0,$$ then what is k? and on what factors it depends?
9. Why magnetic field does not increase energy of beam?
10. Why is there * on $\beta$?
11. What is instantaneous luminosity?
13. List the neutral hadrons that are detected by ECAL and HCAL?
14. How you measure the momentum of muons?
15. Compare the resolution of electrons and muons?
16. If we use the muon system information for calculating the muon momentum resoution then will it increase the momentum resolution or decrease?
17. What is the difference between the Decision Tree (DT) and the Boosted Decision Tree (BDT)?
18. How you handle the uncertanity into the account if you use the BDT?
19. Is there any process from where one can get same sign electrons and muons in final state?
20. If signal strength, ($\mu<1$), do you think you overestimated some/any of your background?
